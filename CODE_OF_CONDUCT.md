# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

This project exists at the intersection of AI, companionship, and personal connection. We recognize that people building with this template are creating something intimate and meaningful. We ask that all interactions in this space reflect that care.

## Standards

**Be respectful.** People's relationships with AI companions are personal. Don't dismiss, mock, or pathologize what others are building.

**Be helpful.** If someone is stuck, share what you know. If you built something cool, share how you did it.

**Be honest.** If something doesn't work, say so. If you don't know, say that too.

**Respect privacy.** Don't share others' companion details, configurations, or personal information without permission.

## Scope

This applies to all spaces associated with this project: issues, discussions, and any community channels.

## Enforcement

Unacceptable behavior can be reported to the maintainers. We'll address it as we see fit. This is a small project — we trust the community to be decent to each other.
